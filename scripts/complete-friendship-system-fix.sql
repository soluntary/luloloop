-- Complete friendship system fix
-- This script will drop and recreate all RLS policies for the friendship system

-- First, disable RLS temporarily to clean up
ALTER TABLE friend_requests DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE friends DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop all existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own sent requests" ON friend_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own received requests" ON friend_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can send friend requests" ON friend_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own requests" ON friend_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their friendships" ON friends;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create friendships" ON friends;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their friendships" ON friends;

-- Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE friend_requests ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE friends ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create comprehensive RLS policies for friend_requests

-- Grant necessary permissions
GRANT ALL ON friend_requests TO authenticated;

-- Ensure the tables have the correct structure
